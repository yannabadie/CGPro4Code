```
$ cgpro ask --web "what's the top story on Hacker News right now, in 2 lines?"
Thinking…
gpt ▸ The current top story on HN is "OpenAI ships GPT-5.5 Pro to API"
       (892 points), discussing the just-announced API rollout and pricing.
```

## Why this exists

As of April 2026:

- **GPT-5.5 Pro** lives only in the consumer ChatGPT app (web + mobile). It is
  not in the public OpenAI API yet, and **not** exposed by the official Codex
  CLI either (which serves the standard `gpt-5.5` Thinking model).
- The only practical way to script `gpt-5.5-pro` from a terminal is to drive
  the same UI a logged-in user would.

`cgpro` does that, via **Playwright + a real Chrome instance with a persistent
profile**. You log in once with `cgpro login`; every subsequent `ask` or
`chat` reuses the same session. Cloudflare/sentinel anti-bot tokens are
produced by the page's own JavaScript — we don't reimplement them, which is
what makes this approach **stable** across OpenAI's frequent backend changes.

## Install

Requirements: Node.js ≥ 20 and Chrome (or Chromium) installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yannabadie/CGPro4Code.git cgpro
cd cgpro
npm install
npx playwright install chromium    # bundled fallback if Chrome is missing
npm run build
npm link                           # installs the `cgpro` command globally
```

After `npm link`, the `cgpro` command is on your `PATH`. If you skip
`npm link`, run it from the repo with `node dist/cli/index.js …` instead.

## First run

```bash
cgpro login
```

A Chrome window opens at `chatgpt.com`. Sign in (handle 2FA / Cloudflare if
needed). Once the chat home is visible the command exits with `✔ Logged in`.

```bash
cgpro status
# Account:      you@example.com
# Plan:         pro
# Token until:  …
# Models:       17 available
# GPT-5.5 Pro:  ✓ (slug: gpt-5-5-pro)
```

## Usage

### One-shot prompt

```bash
cgpro ask "explain CRDTs in 3 bullet points"
cgpro ask --web "today's weather in Lyon"
cgpro ask --no-web "give me a strict TypeScript type for ISO-8601 dates"
cgpro ask -i diagram.png "explain this architecture"
echo "review this code" | cgpro ask < src/api/me.ts
cgpro ask --json "ping" | jq .
```

### Interactive chat

```bash
cgpro chat
# you ▸ what's the safest way to migrate a 50M-row table to add a NOT NULL column?
# gpt ▸ …
# you ▸ :web off
# you ▸ :save db-migrations
# you ▸ :quit
```

For multi-line prompts, end a line with a trailing backslash `\`. The next
prompt will continue the same turn:

```text
you ▸ first line of context \
    ▸ second line \
    ▸ now actually ask the question
```

Built-in slash commands:

### Threads

```bash
cgpro thread list
cgpro thread show db-migrations
cgpro thread save <uuid> mybranch     # adopt an existing chatgpt.com thread
cgpro chat --resume db-migrations     # continue the saved thread
cgpro thread rm db-migrations
```

### Diagnostics

```bash
cgpro status      # session + plan + GPT-5.5 Pro detection
cgpro models      # list models the account has access to
cgpro doctor      # audit selectors against live chatgpt.com DOM
cgpro logout      # wipe the local profile
```

## Architecture

```
~/.cgpro/                   ← env-paths default location
├── profile/                ← Chromium user data dir (cookies, IndexedDB)
├── threads.json            ← name ↔ chatgpt.com UUID
└── config.json             ← user defaults (model, web, headless, …)
```

- **`src/browser/selectors.ts`** is the only file that knows DOM details.
  When chatgpt.com ships a UI change, patch this file. `cgpro doctor` audits
  it against the live page.
- **Streaming** is captured by injecting a fetch interceptor (`addInitScript`)
  that mirrors `/backend-api/conversation` SSE chunks into a Node binding.
  The page issues the real request — we shadow-stream it.
- **Composer** is driven via the page UI (typing into `#prompt-textarea`,
  clicking the send button) so OpenAI's own JS produces the proof tokens.

See [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-25-cgpro-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-25-cgpro-design.md)
for the full design doc and rationale.

## Stability

- Selectors have ordered fallback chains in `selectors.ts`.
- The fetch interceptor is registered **once per browser context**, before any
  navigation, so it catches the very first `/backend-api/conversation` POST.
  Per-turn we just swap which emitter the binding routes to (no double-register
  bug across REPL turns).
- `cgpro doctor` is the first thing to run when something breaks.
- Unit tests (`npm test`) cover the SSE parser, the threads store, and selector
  shape integrity.
- Live smoke (`CGPRO_LIVE=1 npm run test:live`) is opt-in and exercises a real
  account — keep this disabled in CI by default.

### First-run smoke checklist

After `cgpro login` succeeds, run these in order — each verifies a different
layer:

1. `cgpro status` — session JWT + plan + GPT-5.5 Pro detection.
2. `cgpro doctor` — every selector resolves on the live DOM.
3. `cgpro ask "ping in one word"` — composer typing + send + SSE stream + done.
4. `cgpro ask --web "today's date in Lyon"` — web search toggle + sources.
5. `cgpro chat` — open the REPL, send 3 turns, `:save smoke`, `:quit`. Re-open
   with `cgpro chat --resume smoke` and confirm context is preserved.

If step 3 hangs forever with no streaming, run `cgpro doctor` and look for
the first `✖` — usually the composer or send-button selector drifted, and a
one-line patch in `selectors.ts` fixes it.
